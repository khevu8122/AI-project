# AI-project
This project is basically taken from Circuitnet.com where in they have made the IR drop prediction, DRC violation and Congestion prediction. 
All 3 are related and at the end we get the IR drop map, Congestion map and DRC violations map. 

In this project, we have used feature set of 10 and label set of 10 examples. 

There are multiple types of powers used in this project like static power, scaling power, dynamic power, etc for the understanding. 

The final IR_Drop file will be generating the prediction. 

The flow of project contains 
train.py 
test.py 
Project.py has the code for making images of the features and labels


After the successful compilation of the codes we will get the prediction.
